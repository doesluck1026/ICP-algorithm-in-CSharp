# ICP algorithm in CSharp
 Fast Iterative Closest Point algorithm implementation in C#

 This project is based on Rigid Registration Iterative Closest Point Tutorial which can be found 
 in http://www.sci.utah.edu/~shireen/pdfs/tutorials/Elhabian_ICP09.pdf
 This also uses Supercluster KD-Tree algorithm by Eric Regina (https://github.com/eric-regina).

 Examples are also included in project.
